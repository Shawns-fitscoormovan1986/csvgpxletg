Just walked outta Thudarum. Wow, honestly I'm a bit dazed—like when you eat too much cotton candy and your head feels all fizzy. Okay, so the theater was noisy, right? People chatting over the intense dialogue, but whatever, adds to the vibe. Anyway, crumbs everywhere—I mean, is there even a point to those flimsy napkins they give you? My back feels like I've been carrying around a backpack full of bricks, so I'm clearly adding that to my throat's to-do list.

Anyway, the   itself—a visual jazz, like really man, it was choppy but in a totally deliberate, syncopated kinda way. Like if your dreams were melting into each other one after another. Imagine trying to cram an ocean into a fishbowl. Somehow the director nearly pulled that off. There was this scene, right, where the main guy stands there, just looking at a wilted sunflower against a neon city backdrop—felt like an emotional punch and a weird cosmic joke at the same time.

> And can we just talk about that one sequence with the old truck? It was almost as if it had a soul of its own, lumbering through barren landscapes that looked like they were lifted straight outta someone's fever dream. I swear the truck was a metaphor for my life, barely moving, carrying too much, and definitely in need of a tune-up.

Ah, and the soundtrack, oh god. Conveys this madd-i-ness but also somehow soothing? Like heavy metal, but if it was remixed by monks. Somehow. There’s a rhythm that got stuck in my brain, like the one time I accidentally stapled my fingers together in high school. Yeah, gonna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movi... no, wait, someone’s definitely already asked me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again.

That villain, Sid... was his name Sid? Doesn’t matter, his laugh more contagious than hiccups during a silent meditation retreat. Had my mind spinning like... like those class presentations you forgot to do but still finesse your way through them.

And then it all loops back—closing shot, perfectly imperfect. Felt almost ritualistic, like an ancient storytelling dance but with neon chaos sprinkled all around it. Seriously, whenever you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , prepare yourself for that ending—left me with goosebumps the size of popcorn kernels.

Alright, time to stop rambling. Need to lie down, somewhere soft preferably, and just... decompress or something.
